# Project Description

This is a production planning tool where users model multiple scenarios, each containing a set of projects and a production-capacity curve. A project has a start date, a total area target, a complexity multiplier, a priority weight, and a muted flag. The system converts total area into an equivalent workload using the complexity multiplier, then simulates progress day by day. On each day, all active (started, unmuted, unfinished) projects share that day's capacity in proportion to their priority; a project's end date is the first day its remaining workload reaches zero. Production capacity is defined by dated points that form a curve, with values interpolated between points and extrapolated at the bounds so the curve covers the visible schedule range. Scenarios are first-class: users can create, rename, duplicate, and delete them, with new scenarios receiving default capacity points. Project ordering within a scenario is tracked separately from scheduling calculations.

# Major UI/UX Decisions

The main workspace centers on a Gantt-style timeline that visually shows project bars by date. Users can drag bars to adjust start dates and get immediate visual feedback. A dedicated capacity graph sits above the timeline, allowing direct manipulation of the production curve with point-based edits and a switch between daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly views. Project actions are exposed via context menus and hover cards to keep the timeline uncluttered while still providing quick access to edit, delete, reorder, and mute controls. Scenario management lives in the header, combining selection with inline renaming and always-visible copy, delete, and new actions. Project creation and editing use a modal form to keep data entry focused and prevent accidental timeline changes. Summary and tooltip overlays provide aggregate metrics without pulling users away from the schedule view.
